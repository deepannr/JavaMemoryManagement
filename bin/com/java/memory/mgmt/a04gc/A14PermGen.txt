Here in heap, perm gen is the space where it will not be garbage collected.
In JDK 1.7, internal strings are not stored in perm gen space. (A14PermGen01.JPG)
In Jdk 1.8, perm gen space is ultimately removed and added as meta data space. (A14PermGen_Metadata01.JPG)
Here meta space is completely outside of heap space. Whenever the application is deployed then the meta data grows.
