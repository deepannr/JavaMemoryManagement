In C, when the memory to be cleaned then need to use .free()
In VB when the memory to be cleaned then the variables to be assigned to NULL.

If not even when the program ends, the objects will be stored in the memory of OS and ultimately will happen memory leak and crash.
To overcome this need to restart the OS.

No need if those C or VB running on the web server.

This is not the case of Java. As Java running on a Virtual Machine. When a variable is assigned then it is not stored to the OS memory where as it is stored in the VM's memory.

Java Memory leaks can be avoided by
1. Running on VM
2. Garbage Collection

GC is implemented in 1959 in LISP programming language and Java used that concept and made popular on GC.

When the programmers keep create the variables on heap, then a separate process will be running which works on the objects which are no longer used and they are cleared.

Rule: Any object from the heap which is not referenced through the stack is eligible for garbage collected. Here is unreachable object but not unreferenced objects

In A10GC02.JPG even though if Customer A and Customer B object has reference as the list don't have any reference from Stack all 3 objects are eligible for GC.

In A10GC03CircularRefr.JPG Obj A, B, C are referenced to each other (Circular Reference) and there is no reference from the stack all 3 objects are eligible for GC.

The whole process is apart from the programmer.
