In Java it is possible to create Weak and Soft references like A17WeakAndSoftRefr01.JPG

Weak Reference - Will not survive on GC. If object is declared as weak, although the reference is there in
	Stack then the object will be GC in heap. If not then the var3 will be null.

Soft Reference - If the space is needed in heap then only it will be destroyed. Stronger than Weak.
